## Features
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach
- Dual targeting strategy for high code coverage (100%)
- Enables internal pull-up resistor of the button pin
- Updates debounced state of the button with an update function
- Stable and reliable button state detection (5 consecutive states)
- Detects debounced "RELEASED" and "PRESSED" states
- Detects debounced "RISING" and "FALLING" edges
- Availability of edges within one interval
- Unique event reading for each edge

## Getting Started
  To get started with the button module, follow these steps:

  - Clone this repository to your local machine.
  - Connect a push button to pin 34 of ESP32.
  - Set up your development environment and ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
  
## Usage
- Include the button module in your project.
- Initialize the button module and configure it according to your requirements.
- Call the update function of the button module periodically to update the debounced state.
- Utilize the button module's functions to detect button states, edges, and perform necessary actions based on them.

 ## Testing
 To build and run the tests for the button module, you can use cmake. Here's how:
 -Make sure you have cmake installed on your system.
- Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
- Create a build directory:
 
 ```
 mkdir build
 cd build
 ```
 Generate the build files with cmake:

 ```
 cmake ..
```
 Build and run the test:
 
 ```
 make coverage_test_button
 ```
 The Unity tests will be executed, and you will see the test results in the terminal. and when you open the build folder you will see a index.html file  Ensure that all the tests pass successfully.
